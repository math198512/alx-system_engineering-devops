       ssuu allows to run commands with a substitute user and group ID.

       When called without arguments, ssuu defaults to running an interactive shell as _r_o_o_t.

       For  backward compatibility, ssuu defaults to not change the current directory and to only set the environment variables HHOOMMEE and SSHHEELLLL (plus UUSSEERR and LLOOGGNNAAMMEE
       if the target _u_s_e_r is not root).  It is recommended to always use the ----llooggiinn option (instead of its shortcut --) to avoid side effects caused by mixing  en‐
       vironments.

       This  version of ssuu uses PAM for authentication, account and session management.  Some configuration options found in other ssuu implementations, such as sup‐
       port for a wheel group, have to be configured via PAM.

       ssuu is mostly designed for unprivileged users, the recommended solution for privileged users (e.g. scripts executed by root) is to use  non-set-user-ID  com‐
       mand  rruunnuusseerr(1)  that  does not require authentication and provide separate PAM configuration. If the PAM session is not required at all then the recommend
       solution is to use command sseettpprriivv(1).

       --PP, ----ppttyy
              Create  pseudo-terminal for the session. The independent terminal provides better security as user does not share terminal with the original session.
              This allow to avoid TIOCSTI ioctl terminal injection and another security attacks against terminal file descriptors. The all session is also possible
              to  move  to background (e.g. "su --pty - username -c application &"). If the pseudo-terminal is enabled then su command works as a proxy between the
              sessions (copy stdin and stdout).

              This feature is mostly designed for interactive sessions. If the standard input is not a terminal, but for example pipe (e.g. echo "date" | su --pty)
              than ECHO flag for the pseudo-terminal is disabled to avoid messy output.

       --ss, ----sshheellll=_s_h_e_l_l
              Run the specified _s_h_e_l_l instead of the default.  The shell to run is selected according to the following rules, in order:

                 o      the shell specified with ----sshheellll

                 o      the shell specified in the environment variable SSHHEELLLL, if the ----pprreesseerrvvee--eennvviirroonnmmeenntt option is used

                 o      the shell listed in the passwd entry of the target user

                 o      /bin/sh

              If the target user has a restricted shell (i.e. not listed in /etc/shells), the ----sshheellll option and the SSHHEELLLL environment variables are ignored unless
              the calling user is root.

       ssuu normally returns the exit status of the command it executed.  If the command was killed by a signal, ssuu returns the number of the signal plus 128.

                 1      Generic error before executing the requested command

       For security reasons ssuu always logs failed log-in attempts to the btmp file, but it does not write to the lastlog file at all.  This solution allows to con‐
       trol ssuu behavior by PAM configuration.  If you want to use the pam_lastlog module to print warning message about failed log-in attempts then the pam_lastlog
       has to be configured to update the lastlog file as well. For example by:
